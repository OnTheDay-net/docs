# Before Your Race Day Event
Your event should be preconfigured. If you are a race promoter (and have administrator privileges), you can see and even make changes to some settings for your event.

```note
Although it's tempting to make changes, it's not a good idea. 

```
## Things you can change

TBD

## Things you can't change

Even with privileges you can't change:
- Date of the event
- Race category names

```note
If you need to make a change to a date or category, contact us. 
```

## How can I see my event?

When you log in, you can see a link to each of your race day events.
