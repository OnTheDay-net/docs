# Race Configuration Report
The race configuration report is a sheet that lists all kinds of good information that the officials and racers will want to know. 
It's a good idea to email or print a few copies for the officials.

This report contains these unique bits of information:
- Sequential event numbers, names, times, number range(s), field limit
- Number of categories per event 
- Race details

The next image shows a sample report.
